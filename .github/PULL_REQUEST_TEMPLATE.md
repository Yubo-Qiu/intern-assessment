Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
Yubo Qiu

2. How long did you work on this project?
1 hr 45mins
45 mins for everything except the filter, then another 45 mins for the filter. I got stuck on the filter on a very small issue, I did not know command S does not restart the server, I thought it does because all the front end changes can be seen without restarting the server. Another 15 mins for answering this questions and clearing not needed files. 

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
I think all the parts are pretty reasonable; they test pretty basic knoweledge of backend and database and so on. I most challenging part I guess is the time. I am a slow coder, so I did not have time to write front end. 

4. What did you learn from this project?
I learned I need to use "control C + npm start" to restart the server when I can not figure out where the bug is from and my code looks fine. Sometimes the issue is this simple. 

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
I added the function of a toggle switch to mark task from "completed" back to "pending" since sometimes people misclick. I think for the delete button, there should be a warning window, but I didnt do it due to time constrains. I hide the buttons to modify tasks' statues inside of the description page of each task, but maybe there should be some shortcuts. Because people might want to delete or mark as complete multiple tasks at the same time. 

On a bigger scale, maybe some functionalities related to time or schedules would help (like when each task is due or maybe all the tasks can be viewed on a calender). Some coloring to indicate the importance of each task could be helpful too. 

6. What is your feedback on this project?
I might need to code faster and try not to stuck on some little things and waste time. But overall this is a fun project and all the requirements are definitely reasonable.

7. What is your suggestion for this project?
Maybe there could be more space of creativities. Like right now all the functionalities are indicated and we need to strictly follow the instructions. But maybe we can know a big picture (like we need a management system for students or professors), then we can analyze what functionalities are useful so to show our creativity.
